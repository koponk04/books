## CHAPTER 1 - The Path to Disaster: The Product Development Model

### The Product Development Model

#### Concept - Dev - Testing - Launch

1. Concept and Seed Stage
- What is the product or service concept? Is it possible to build? Is further technical research needed to ensure the product can be built? 
- What are the product features and benefits?
- Who will the customers be and where will they be found?
- How the product will ultimately reach the customer and the potential distribution channel?

2. Product Development
- Everyone stops talking and starts working.
- Webvan's case - Engineering - Building the automated warehouses and designing the website.

3. Alpha/Beta Test

4. Product Launch and First Customer Ship

#### What's Wrong?

The Product Development model is not a marketing, sales hiring, customer acquisition, or even a financing model. Yet startup companies have traditionally used a Product Development model to manage and pace all these non-engineering activities

1. Where Are the Customers?
> Look at the Product Development model and ask, “Where are the customers?”
2. The Focus on First Customer Ship Date
> ~~Customer Ship Date~~ => **Customer Discovery**
- Most precious asset — cash.
3. An Emphasis on Execution Instead of Learning and Discovery
> **Customer Development process**

> Product Development model => its Linear Flow (Not **Recursive Circles**)
- What are the problems our product solves?
- Do customers perceive these problems as important or “must-have”?
- If we're selling to businesses, who in a company has a problem our product could solve?
- If we are selling to consumers how do we reach them?
- How big is this problem?
- Who do we make the first sales call on?
- Who else has to approve the purchase?
- How many customers do we need to be profitable?
- What's the average order size?
4. The Lack of Meaningful Sales, Marketing and Business Development Milestones
> What kind of objectives would a startup want or need?

> A startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of customers and their problems, their pains, and the jobs they need done to discover a repeatable roadmap of how they buy, and building a financial model that results in profitability.
- How well do we understand what problems customers have?
- How much will they pay to solve those problems?
- Do our product features solve these problems?
- Do we understand our customers’ business?
- Do we understand the hierarchy of customer needs?
- Have we found visionary customers, ones who will buy our product early?
- Is our product a must-have for these customers?
- Do we understand the sales roadmap well enough to consistently sell the product?
- Do we understand what we need to be profitable?
- Are the sales and business plans realistic, scalable, and achievable?
- What do we do if our model turns out to be wrong?
5. The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Sales
> Product Development Waterfall - Customer Development activities => They both measure something, but not the thing you wanted.
6. The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Marketing
> In a startup no facts exist inside the building, only opinions.

> Product Development model => When does Marketing find out whether the positioning, buzz, and demand creation activities actually work? After first customer ship [BAD]
7. Premature Scaling
8. Death Spiral: The Cost of Getting Product Launch Wrong
> Premature scaling is the immediate cause of the Death Spiral

> By the time of first customer ship, if the company does not understand its market and customers, the consequences unfold in a startup ritual.
9. Not All Startups Are Alike
> Since the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance, their sales and marketing strategies differ dramatically. Even more serious, each Market Type has radically different cash needs.
- Startups four basic categories
a. Bringing a new product into an existing market
b. Bringing a new product into a new market
c. Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a low-cost entrant
d. Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a niche entrant
10. Unrealistic Expectations
- The Product Development model can be relied upon to guide activities that have nothing to do with Product Development—namely, finding customers, a market, and a viable business model.
- Customer Development will move on the same schedule as Product Development.
- All types of startups and all new products will achieve acceptance and deployment at the same rate, namely starting at First Customer Ship.
- Startups face enormous pressure from their investors to become profitable

#### So What's The Alternative?
