## CHAPTER 1 - The Path to Disaster: The Product Development Model

### The Product Development Model

#### Concept - Dev - Testing - Launch

1. Concept and Seed Stage
- What is the product or service concept? Is it possible to build? Is further technical research needed to ensure the product can be built? 
- What are the product features and benefits?
- Who will the customers be and where will they be found?
- How the product will ultimately reach the customer and the potential distribution channel?

2. Product Development
- Everyone stops talking and starts working.
- Webvan's case - Engineering - Building the automated warehouses and designing the website.

3. Alpha/Beta Test

4. Product Launch and First Customer Ship

#### What's Wrong?

The Product Development model is not a marketing, sales hiring, customer acquisition, or even a financing model. Yet startup companies have traditionally used a Product Development model to manage and pace all these non-engineering activities

1. Where Are the Customers?
> Look at the Product Development model and ask, “Where are the customers?”
2. The Focus on First Customer Ship Date
> ~~Customer Ship Date~~ => **Customer Discovery**
- Most precious asset — cash.
3. An Emphasis on Execution Instead of Learning and Discovery
> **Customer Development process**

> Product Development model => its Linear Flow (Not **Recursive Circles**)
- What are the problems our product solves?
- Do customers perceive these problems as important or “must-have”?
- If we're selling to businesses, who in a company has a problem our product could solve?
- If we are selling to consumers how do we reach them?
- How big is this problem?
- Who do we make the first sales call on?
- Who else has to approve the purchase?
- How many customers do we need to be profitable?
- What's the average order size?
4. The Lack of Meaningful Sales, Marketing and Business Development Milestones
> What kind of objectives would a startup want or need?

> A startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of customers and their problems, their pains, and the jobs they need done to discover a repeatable roadmap of how they buy, and building a financial model that results in profitability.
- How well do we understand what problems customers have?
- How much will they pay to solve those problems?
- Do our product features solve these problems?
- Do we understand our customers’ business?
- Do we understand the hierarchy of customer needs?
- Have we found visionary customers, ones who will buy our product early?
- Is our product a must-have for these customers?
- Do we understand the sales roadmap well enough to consistently sell the product?
- Do we understand what we need to be profitable?
- Are the sales and business plans realistic, scalable, and achievable?
- What do we do if our model turns out to be wrong?
5. The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Sales
> Product Development Waterfall - Customer Development activities => They both measure something, but not the thing you wanted.
6. The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Marketing
> In a startup no facts exist inside the building, only opinions.

> Product Development model => When does Marketing find out whether the positioning, buzz, and demand creation activities actually work? After first customer ship [BAD]
7. Premature Scaling
8. Death Spiral: The Cost of Getting Product Launch Wrong
> Premature scaling is the immediate cause of the Death Spiral

> By the time of first customer ship, if the company does not understand its market and customers, the consequences unfold in a startup ritual.
9. Not All Startups Are Alike
> Since the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance, their sales and marketing strategies differ dramatically. Even more serious, each Market Type has radically different cash needs.
- Startups four basic categories
a. Bringing a new product into an existing market
b. Bringing a new product into a new market
c. Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a low-cost entrant
d. Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a niche entrant
10. Unrealistic Expectations
- The Product Development model can be relied upon to guide activities that have nothing to do with Product Development—namely, finding customers, a market, and a viable business model.
- Customer Development will move on the same schedule as Product Development.
- All types of startups and all new products will achieve acceptance and deployment at the same rate, namely starting at First Customer Ship.
- Startups face enormous pressure from their investors to become profitable

#### So What's The Alternative?

**The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve**

The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve provides true insight, because there are different types of customers in a company/product life cycle. However, this seductive curve leads early-stage entrepreneurs to four bad conclusions:

- The curve naturally leads entrepreneurs to entertain dreams of glory in the mainstream market
- The curve invites us to think of technology enthusiasts as one part of the customer adoption curve
- The notion that a startup's customer base will grow in a smooth, continuous curve invites the tempting and dangerous idea that customer adoption is simply a sales execution problem.
- The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve emphasize “execution and adoption.”. In the early stages of a startup, focusing on “execution” will put you out of business. Instead, you need a “learning and discovery” process so you can get the company to the point where you know what to execute.

> The first step for a startup is to focus on learning and discovery processes, from starting the company to scaling the business. **Customer Development**

**Customer Development: Common Sense Meets the Product Development Model**

> Learning and discovering who a company's initial customers will be, and what markets they are in, requires a separate and distinct process from Product Development. Learning about customers and their problems as early in the development process as possible. The model is built on the idea that every startup has a set of definable milestones no amount of funding can accelerate.

## CHAPTER 2 - The Path to Epiphany: The Customer Development Model

### The Four Steps To The Epiphany

#### The Customer Development Model

![image](https://github.com/koponk04/books/raw/development-path-to-epiphany/The%20Four%20Steps%20to%20the%20Epiphany/images/The%20Customer%20Development%20Model.png)

> The circles and arrows highlight the iterative nature of each step
> The first three steps can be accomplished with a staff that can fit in a phone booth.
> Goal: proving there is a profitable, scalable business for the company

1. Customer Discovery

- Finding out who the customers for your product are and whether the problem you believe you are solving is important to them.
- Discovering whether the problem, product and customer hypotheses in your business plan are correct.
- The goal of Customer Development is not to collect feature lists from prospective customers, nor is it to run lots of focus groups.
- The founders and Product Development team define the first product. The job of the Customer Development team is to see whether there are customers and a market for that vision.
- Lessons learned and what didn't work.

2. Customer Validation

- Build a repeatable sales roadmap for the sales and marketing teams that will follow later.
- Goal 1 + 2
  * Verifies your market
  * Locates your customers
  * Tests the perceived value of your product
  * Identifies the economic buyer
  * Establishes your pricing and channel strategy
  * Checks out your sales cycle and process
- If, and only if, you find a group of repeatable customers with a repeatable sales process, and then find those customers yield a profitable business model, do you move to the next step (scaling up and crossing the Chasm).

3. Customer Creation

- To create end-user demand and drive that demand into the company's sales channel
- Allowing the company to control its cash-burn rate and protect its most precious asset.

4. Company Building

- Where the company transitions from its informal, learning and discovery-oriented Customer Development team into formal departments with VPs of Sales, Marketing and Business Development

#### The Four Types Of Startup Markets

> I don't understand what happened. We did everything that worked in our last startup

> Even with essentially identical products and team, "A" would have failed if it had used the same sales and marketing strategy used successfully at "B".
> **It is a fallacy to believe the strategy and tactics that worked for one startup should be appropriate in another. That's because Market Type changes everything a company does**

![image](https://github.com/koponk04/books/raw/development-path-to-epiphany/The%20Four%20Steps%20to%20the%20Epiphany/images/Market%20Type.png)

1. **A New Product in an Existing Market**

- If your product offers higher performance than what is currently offered
- The users and the market are known, but so are the competitors
- Competitors define the market. The basis of competition is therefore all about the product and product features.

2. **A New Product in a New Market**

- When a company creates a large customer base that couldn't do something before
- [GOOD] Your product features are at first irrelevant because there are no competitors (except other pesky startups)
- [BAD] The users and the market are undefined and unknown.
- [PROBLEM] How to convince a set of customers your vision is not a hallucination
- [PROBLEM] How to manage the cash-burn rate during the adoption phase
- [PROBLEM] How to manage and find investors who are patient and have deep pockets.

3. **A New Product Attempting to Resegment an Existing Market: Low Cost**

- Segmentation means you've picked a clear and distinct spot in customers’ minds that is unique, understandable, and, most important, concerns something they value and want and need now.
- Are there customers at the low end of an existing marketing who will buy “good enough” performance if they could get it at a substantially lower price?
- Needs a long-term product plan that uses low cost as market entry to eventual profitability and up-market growth

4. **A New Product Attempting to Resegment an Existing Market: Niche**

- Would some part of this market buy a new product designed to address their specific needs? Even if it cost more? Or had worse performance in an aspect of the product irrelevant to this niche?
- Faces entrenched competitors who will fiercely defend their profitable markets

##### Market Type and the Customer Development Process

![image](https://github.com/koponk04/books/raw/development-path-to-epiphany/The%20Four%20Steps%20to%20the%20Epiphany/images/Market%20Type%20Characteristics.png)

#### Synchronizing Product Development And Customer Development

- Customer Development and Product Development are parallel processes
- Customer Development : Customer-centric activities outside the building
- Product Development: Product-centric activities taking place internally
- In big companies, the product spec is market-driven; in startups, the marketing is product-driven.

> In each step—Customer Discovery, Customer Validation, Customer Creation and Company Building—the Product Development and Customer Development teams hold a series of formal “synchronization” meetings. Unless the two groups agree, Customer Development does not move forward to the next step.

> In Customer Discovery, the Customer Development team strives to validate the product spec, not come up with a new set of features. Only if customers do not agree there's a problem to be solved, think the problem is not painful, or don't deem the product spec solves their problem, do the Customer and Product Development teams reconvene to add or refine features.

> Also in Customer Discovery, when customers have consistently said that new or modified product features are required, the VP of Product Development goes out with the team to listen to customer feedback before new features are added.

> In Customer Validation, key members of the Product Development team go out in front of customers as part of the pre-sales support team.

> In Company Building, the Product Development team does installations and support for initial product while training the support and service staff.
