## CHAPTER 1 - The Path to Disaster: The Product Development Model

### The Product Development Model

#### Concept - Dev - Testing - Launch

1. Concept and Seed Stage
- What is the product or service concept? Is it possible to build? Is further technical research needed to ensure the product can be built? 
- What are the product features and benefits?
- Who will the customers be and where will they be found?
- How the product will ultimately reach the customer and the potential distribution channel?

2. Product Development
- Everyone stops talking and starts working.
- Webvan's case - Engineering - Building the automated warehouses and designing the website.

3. Alpha/Beta Test

4. Product Launch and First Customer Ship

#### What's Wrong?

The Product Development model is not a marketing, sales hiring, customer acquisition, or even a financing model. Yet startup companies have traditionally used a Product Development model to manage and pace all these non-engineering activities

1. Where Are the Customers?
> Look at the Product Development model and ask, “Where are the customers?”
2. The Focus on First Customer Ship Date
> ~~Customer Ship Date~~ => **Customer Discovery**
- Most precious asset — cash.
3. An Emphasis on Execution Instead of Learning and Discovery
> **Customer Development process**

> Product Development model => its Linear Flow (Not **Recursive Circles**)
- What are the problems our product solves?
- Do customers perceive these problems as important or “must-have”?
- If we're selling to businesses, who in a company has a problem our product could solve?
- If we are selling to consumers how do we reach them?
- How big is this problem?
- Who do we make the first sales call on?
- Who else has to approve the purchase?
- How many customers do we need to be profitable?
- What's the average order size?
4. The Lack of Meaningful Sales, Marketing and Business Development Milestones
> What kind of objectives would a startup want or need?

> A startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of customers and their problems, their pains, and the jobs they need done to discover a repeatable roadmap of how they buy, and building a financial model that results in profitability.
- How well do we understand what problems customers have?
- How much will they pay to solve those problems?
- Do our product features solve these problems?
- Do we understand our customers’ business?
- Do we understand the hierarchy of customer needs?
- Have we found visionary customers, ones who will buy our product early?
- Is our product a must-have for these customers?
- Do we understand the sales roadmap well enough to consistently sell the product?
- Do we understand what we need to be profitable?
- Are the sales and business plans realistic, scalable, and achievable?
- What do we do if our model turns out to be wrong?
5. The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Sales
> Product Development Waterfall - Customer Development activities => They both measure something, but not the thing you wanted.
6. The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Marketing
> In a startup no facts exist inside the building, only opinions.

> Product Development model => When does Marketing find out whether the positioning, buzz, and demand creation activities actually work? After first customer ship [BAD]
7. Premature Scaling
8. Death Spiral: The Cost of Getting Product Launch Wrong
> Premature scaling is the immediate cause of the Death Spiral

> By the time of first customer ship, if the company does not understand its market and customers, the consequences unfold in a startup ritual.
9. Not All Startups Are Alike
> Since the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance, their sales and marketing strategies differ dramatically. Even more serious, each Market Type has radically different cash needs.
- Startups four basic categories
a. Bringing a new product into an existing market
b. Bringing a new product into a new market
c. Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a low-cost entrant
d. Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a niche entrant
10. Unrealistic Expectations
- The Product Development model can be relied upon to guide activities that have nothing to do with Product Development—namely, finding customers, a market, and a viable business model.
- Customer Development will move on the same schedule as Product Development.
- All types of startups and all new products will achieve acceptance and deployment at the same rate, namely starting at First Customer Ship.
- Startups face enormous pressure from their investors to become profitable

#### So What's The Alternative?

**The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve**

The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve provides true insight, because there are different types of customers in a company/product life cycle. However, this seductive curve leads early-stage entrepreneurs to four bad conclusions:

- The curve naturally leads entrepreneurs to entertain dreams of glory in the mainstream market
- The curve invites us to think of technology enthusiasts as one part of the customer adoption curve
- The notion that a startup's customer base will grow in a smooth, continuous curve invites the tempting and dangerous idea that customer adoption is simply a sales execution problem.
- The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve emphasize “execution and adoption.”. In the early stages of a startup, focusing on “execution” will put you out of business. Instead, you need a “learning and discovery” process so you can get the company to the point where you know what to execute.

> The first step for a startup is to focus on learning and discovery processes, from starting the company to scaling the business. **Customer Development**

**Customer Development: Common Sense Meets the Product Development Model**

> Learning and discovering who a company's initial customers will be, and what markets they are in, requires a separate and distinct process from Product Development. Learning about customers and their problems as early in the development process as possible. The model is built on the idea that every startup has a set of definable milestones no amount of funding can accelerate.

## CHAPTER 2 - The Path to Epiphany: The Customer Development Model

### The Four Steps To The Epiphany

#### The Customer Development Model

> The circles and arrows highlight the iterative nature of each step

1. Customer Discovery

- Finding out who the customers for your product are and whether the problem you believe you are solving is important to them.
- Discovering whether the problem, product and customer hypotheses in your business plan are correct.
- The goal of Customer Development is not to collect feature lists from prospective customers, nor is it to run lots of focus groups.
- The founders and Product Development team define the first product. The job of the Customer Development team is to see whether there are customers and a market for that vision.
- Lessons learned and what didn't work.

2. Customer Validation

- Build a repeatable sales roadmap for the sales and marketing teams that will follow later.
- Goal 1 + 2
  * Verifies your market
  * Locates your customers
  * Tests the perceived value of your product
  * Identifies the economic buyer
  * Establishes your pricing and channel strategy
  * Checks out your sales cycle and process
- If, and only if, you find a group of repeatable customers with a repeatable sales process, and then find those customers yield a profitable business model, do you move to the next step (scaling up and crossing the Chasm).

3. Customer Creation

- To create end-user demand and drive that demand into the company's sales channel
- Allowing the company to control its cash-burn rate and protect its most precious asset.

4. Company Building

- Where the company transitions from its informal, learning and discovery-oriented Customer Development team into formal departments with VPs of Sales, Marketing and Business Development
